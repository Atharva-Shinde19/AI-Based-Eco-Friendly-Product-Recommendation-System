# 🌱 EcoSmart Recommender
AI-Based Eco-Friendly Product Recommendation System

## 📌 Overview
EcoSmart Recommender is a machine learning based web application that suggests sustainable and eco-friendly products to users.  
It analyzes product descriptions using Natural Language Processing (TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity) and recommends similar green alternatives.

The system also calculates an Eco Score (0–10) to rank products based on sustainability.

## 🌱 Eco Score Calculation

Eco score is calculated by:
- Detecting sustainability keywords (bamboo, reusable, biodegradable, etc.)
- Counting keyword matches
- Normalizing to a 0–10 scale

Higher score → More eco-friendly
